# Minesweeper Clone (C++ Console)

🎮 A simple console-based Minesweeper clone built using C++.  
This project was created as a fun way to practice and apply C++ fundamentals, especially Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 🔧 Features

- Fully functional Minesweeper game logic
- Console-based UI
- Randomized mine placement
- Cell reveal logic, including recursive reveal for empty spaces
- Win/loss detection
- Clean, modular code using OOP concepts

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Applied OOP concepts like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **abstraction**
- Practiced writing **clean, maintainable code**
- Improved my ability to **structure and refactor classes** for better file organization
- Gained experience debugging logical errors in game loops and recursive functions

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.cpp` – Entry point for the game
- `Board.h / Board.cpp` – Manages the game board and core logic
- `Game.h / Game.cpp` – Handles game loop and user interaction
- Additional helper files for organization and readability

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rangamach/MinesweeperClone.git
   cd MinesweeperClone
